---

I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Delaware, beginning my studies in August 2025. My research is centered on Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a focus on improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models. I earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of South Florida, graduating with a 3.79 GPA.

My recent research at the AHMR Lab involved developing a multi-agent simulation framework for the board game RISK and creating an evaluation framework for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines to improve inference in rule-based tasks. This work has led to two publications, one accepted at FLAIRS and another submitted to CogSci.

Beyond research, I have practical software engineering experience from my internship at Nucor Steel Texas. There, I developed a Power App for monitoring electricity costs and built a scrap recipe optimization tool using Python and machine learning, which reduced material costs by 5-10%. As a Teaching Assistant for the CS department at USF, I enjoyed mentoring over 80 students and helping them succeed.

I am also passionate about building the tech community. I served as the Co-Director for Hackabull, Tampa's largest hackathon, where I led a team of 12 to organize a successful event for over 500 attendees. I also managed communications for the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), reaching over 1100 STEM students weekly.

Outside of work, I love playing pickleball and cooking.
