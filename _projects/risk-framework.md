title: "Multi-Agent Simulation Framework for RISK"
collection: projects
date: 2024-11-15
excerpt: "Developed a multi-agent simulation framework for the board game RISK, integrating persona-based heuristics using Ollama, resulting in higher AI strategic accuracy."
---
As part of my work at the AHMR Lab, I developed this framework to simulate and analyze strategic gameplay in RISK. The system uses multiple autonomous AI agents, each operating with a distinct persona and strategic heuristics powered by local large language models via Ollama. This approach led to more nuanced and strategically accurate gameplay in simulation tests compared to baseline models.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Multi-Agent Systems, Ollama
