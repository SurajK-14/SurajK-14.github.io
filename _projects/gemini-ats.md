excerpt: "An LLM-powered resume matching tool that analyzes job descriptions and resumes using Google's Gemini API to generate match percentages and tailored HR-style feedback."
---
This project simulates a real-world Applicant Tracking System (ATS). I created an intuitive Streamlit interface where users can input a job description and upload a resume in PDF format. The backend, powered by the Google Gemini Pro API, parses the documents and provides a detailed analysis, including a match score and HR-style feedback. The entire process of PDF parsing and response generation is automated.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Streamlit, Google Gemini API
