excerpt: "A machine learning model that forecasts student academic performance with 96% accuracy based on academic and demographic data."
---
This project involved comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering on a dataset of student academic records. I benchmarked several machine learning models using Scikit-learn to predict final grades. The final model achieved 96% forecast accuracy, and the results were visualized using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn
